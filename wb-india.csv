The project focuses on protection of watersheds, along with community-level capacity building and promotion of livelihoods. The project is spread over an area of around 238,000 ha, ranging from 700 m to 2000 m altitude in 76 selected micro watersheds in the middle Himalayas. About 451 Gram Panchayats (GP) identified in 18 blocks of 11 districts will participate in this project. A total population of 254,000, living in the project area will benefit from these activities.
 Activities financed by additional financing will focus on 20 micro watersheds that have high erosion indices, which are left behind in terms of socio-economic and other criteria and are predominantly situated close to the agricultural frontier. With this targeted approach on the most vulnerable areas, the impact of the project will be positive both in socio-economic and environmental terms. The outcome of the additional financing project will be measured against the following performance indicators: (i) Sustainable Watershed Management mainstreamed into 20 local government plans including parts of watersheds for which two or more Gram Panchayats have shared governance responsibility; (ii) Implementation of alternative technologies and approaches for enhancing water availability for agriculture and other domestic use; (iii) reduction in community dependency of forest for fuel wood and entering markets with medicinal and aromatic plants; (iv) improved knowledge of the impact of climate change on mountain ecosystems translated into coping strategies; (v) new and innovative techniques and approaches for sustainable land an ecosystem management up-scaled within the Uttarakhand state. Performance will be monitored periodically through well defined indicators by external specialists.",,,http://projects.worldbank.org/P124354/uttarakhand-decentralized-watershed-project-additional-financing?lang=en,2011-01-11T00:00:00Z,,Other,10490000,0,7980000,7980000,,,Specific Investment Loan,B,,"Agricultural Extension, Research, and Other Support Activities",Forestry,"Other Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry",Water resource management,Participation and civic engagement

9530,P105184,South Asia,Republic of India,Dropped,Concept Review,IN: Gujarat Solid Waste and Composting,"Throughout the municipalities and cities in Gujarat, municipal solid waste is largely dumped in uncontrolled sites. The Department of Urban Development for the State of Gujarat mandated the Gujarat Urban Development Company, a wholly owned GoG special Purpose vehicle to prepare and Implement a Solid Waste Management Program to cater to the need of the 161 Municipalities in the State. GUDC has adopted a part of the Master Plan prepared earlier, and has refined it further with the objective of ensuring optimum and efficient utilization  of the  asset created under the program. Towards this end various strategies, and technologies are been adopted and assessed so as to ensure that the function of collecting, treating and disposing of waste in an environmentally sound manner. Currently technologies such as  composting of all biodegradable wastes and disposal of residues and inert wastes in engineered landfills have been adopted. Different forms of public private partnerships are also envisaged in the project from the perspective of sustainability. Realizing the importance of this issue, the Department of Urban Development of the Government of Gujarat has designated the Gujarat Urban Development Company Limited to administer, manage the municipal solid waste management project which includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal.  The Master Plan envisages composting and other alternative energy recovery options for treatment of organics and land filling the inert as well as residual compost, in conformity with the MSW 2000 Rules. The MSW 2000 rules specify that any land filling of wastes to be done in fully engineered landfills and prohibit the land filling of organic wastes. The MSW 2000 Rules set out compliance criteria for door to door collection, segregation at source, transportation, processing and final disposal. The goal of these rules is to establish effective MSWM services to protect public health, natural resources and reduce waste generation, separate recyclable materials, and recover compost and energy. However, the rules also recognizes composting as an alternative technology for the processing the organic wastes. To date, the states are catching up on the compliance of the 2000 MSW rules, in particular with regard to the prohibition on landfill ling of organic wastes. The main reasons for the lack of implementation of the MSW 2000 rules are the viability gap for land filling and processing options (including composting), financial constraints of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), as well as limited capacity. Gujarat's Master Plan identifies the clear intent of GUDC to access carbon finance given the inherent difficulties in developing a compost market, and lack of public funds to finance the operations across the state.  Already in February 2006, GUDC discussed the feasibility of accessing carbon finance for the compost program with a World Bank team. In order to reduce costs, impact on the environment, GUDC intends to cluster the 130 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in to 50 (Approximately) clusters for the purpose of land filling MSW in engineered/sanitary landfills according to the environmental and social selection criteria specified in the MSW 2000 Rules.  However, each ULB will have its own composting unit.  The wastes will be segregated into a wet fraction and a dry fraction with the wet biodegradable wastes being composted in vermi or microbial composting.  In accordance with the MSW Rules, the compost will be recovered for reuse and inert wastes from the compost process as well as segregated inert waste will be disposed of in a sanitary/engineered landfill. The project is envisaged to be developed in two phases to account for the level of preparedness of the municipalities across the state: Phase 1: This includes composting units for 130 existing ULBs where GUDC has been designated as a nodal agency to implement MSWM. The estimated waste quantity is approximately 1520tpd (based on the forecast of  2001 census",,,http://projects.worldbank.org/P105184/gujarat-solid-waste-composting?lang=en,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,Waste Management,,,Other urban development,

9737,P102843,South Asia,Republic of India,Dropped,Concept Review,Luhri Hydro Electric Project,"The objectives are to: (a) increase the supply of clean, renewable, low-carbon and peaking energy to India's northern grid; and (b) enhance the reliability of the grid.  The proposed Luhri Hydro Electric Project (LHEP) is located on the Sutlej River in the state of Himachal Pradesh and is planned as a run-of-river project, downstream of the under-construction 412 MW Rampur Hydropower Project (RHP).  The project with 775 MW rated capacity will generate some 3,152 million units (in a 90% hydrologically dependable year). The project will involve construction of an 86 m high concrete gravity dam (with gross reservoir capacity of 35 million cubic meter) near the village of Nirath from which 38.14 km long twin tunnels of 9 m diameter would bring water to an underground power house at the village of Marola, about 40 km downstream of the dam site. With a total potential of 150,000 MW, hydropower remains one of the critical options to address the energy/peak shortages and limit the carbon intensity of the power sector in India. Despite its critical role, the share of hydropower in India's installed capacity has been steadily declining over the past decades.  From 44 percent in 1970, this share has decreased to about 25 percent today, which is suboptimal to meet peak load requirements as well as system and frequency stability.  Hydropower development remains challenging for a number of reasons, including technical (e.g. geological surprises, sediment management); Social and environmental; Financial (capital-intensive, risky and long pay-back periods); and regulatory risk. These factors are expected to limit private sector participation in the medium term, despite efforts by the Government of India (GoI) and individual state governments to encourage private participation. Private companies which had shown a strong initial interest in the hydropower sector, have had mixed experience with developing and operating hydropower plants in India - Private ownership of the current installed hydro capacity is only 3.4 percent of the installed hydro power generation capacity, compared to 14 percent share  of the installed thermal power generation capacity. While exploring mechanisms to expand private participation in hydropower development, the GoI intends to strengthen the capacity of the public sector hydro companies to bring them to the level of top-performing public companies in the power sector. It envisages that the Bank's engagement in the hydropower sector in India will offer the opportunity to implement good technical, environmental and social practices, through a long-term partnership with a few developers in specific states in the Himalayan region. The Bank expects to leverage its support to the proposed LHEP, together with its ongoing support of the RHP in Himachal Pradesh, to help the State of Himachal Pradesh and SJVN Limited (SJVNL) take the lead in demonstrating effective project execution capacity and sustainable development of hydropower to the other hydro-endowed hill states of India. As part of project preparation, ESMAP is providing grant financing to undertake a study to understand the involvement and performance of the private sector in hydropower development in India so far and evaluate the challenges constraining the private sector to increasingly take on the challenge of the sustainable development of the country's hydropower potential. The grant will finance the following activities: (a) Review of the pipeline/shelf of awarded hydropower projects (with a capacity of at least 25 MW) with their key features and development milestone, in the identified Himalayan states in India. (b) Review of the key features of the existing commercial models (Memorandum of Understanding or competitive bidding etc.) being used in different states in the Himalayan region to develop the hydropower potential and what are the lessons learnt from the experience so far.

The partnership would specifically provide a framework to enable individual or cluster of states in India to: -- Mainstream SLEM policy into their sustainable development priorities (e.g. PRSPs), thus strengthening the enabling environment for SLEM. --Promote synergies between the environment and other sectors of the rural economy. --Strengthen capacity for sustanable land management. --Adopt integrated SLEM practices, including water use efficiency, as part of development programs, and scale up viable, innovative and cost-effective practices. --Facilitate co-financing through a programmatic approach. --Reduce transaction costs where development partners (The Bank and UNDP) would use streamlined and harmonized project cycle procedures to develop and approve continuing interventions. The global environment objective of the SLEM Partneship Program is to maintain and restore globally significant ecosystem functions and services through enhanced local capacity to prevent further degradation, restoration of degraded areas, and dissemination, replication and scaling-up of successful SLEM practices within and across individual Indian states. The overall SLEM PP objective is to contribute to poverty alleviation in India by promoting enhanced efficiency of natural resource use, improved land and ecosystem productivity, and reduced vulnerability to extreme weather events (droughts, floods), including the effects of climate change. Specifically the Partnership is expected to support: --Preventing and/or controlling land degradation via restoration of degraded (agricultural and forested) lands and biomass cover in order to produce, harvest, and utilize biomass in ways that maximize productivity as well as carbon sequestration, biodiversity and  sustainable use of water resources. --Enhancing local capacity and institution building and strengthening for improved land and ecosystem management. --Facilitating knowledge dissemination and application of national and international good practices in SLEM within and across states. --Replicating and scaling-up successful land and ecosystem management practices and technologies that maximize synergies across the UN Conventions on Biological Diversity (CBD), Climate Change (FCCC), and Combating Desertification (CCD) conventions. It is expected that the SLEM CPP will significantly enhance local and global environmental benefits, sustainable development, and development assistance impact in India by providing: --Holistic, cross-sectoral interventions that bring together fragmented policies, institutions, and investments in a coordinated and sequenced manner, beginning with  capacity building and policy reforms followed by on-the-ground-investments, --Long-term financial commitment and a level of predictability in resource flows that allows for a more strategic approach, focusing on comprehensive actions, as well enhanced co-financing opportunities, --Reduced transaction costs associated with processing of small individual GEF projects with larger projects (because of the complicating and inherent project preparation and timing concerns, which often impedes task teams from actively developing a suitable portfolio of GEF projects), --An inclusive development assistance framework in which to make investments and share learning which will be open for new partners/states to join as appropriate.",,,http://projects.worldbank.org/P097989/india-sustainable-land-ecosystem-management-country-partnership-program?lang=en,,,,70000000,0,0,0,,,Specific Investment Loan,B,,Forestry,Crops,,Rural policies and institutions,Other environment and natural resources management

10513,P094571,South Asia,Republic of India,Dropped,,Gas Recovery and Reuse from Closure of Three Delhi Landfills (Carbon Finance),"Objective of the project The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) will be closing four uncontrolled MSW dump sites over the next four years. The objectives of the project are to rehabilitate and close these sites in an environmentally sustainable manner including control of methane gas emissions to take advantage of Carbon Finance opportunities. Project description and proposed activities MCD has four active dumping sites at Gazipur, Bhalaswa, Bhalswa Crossing and Okhla, which at present do not have any infrastructure to collect landfill gas emissions. The year of start and the projected year of closing of these four landfill sites are as follows: - Okhla: 1996, 2006 - Gazipur: 1984, 2008 - Bhalswa: 1992, 2005 - Bhalswa Crossing: 1998, 2005 All the 4 sites mentioned above fall under the category of uncontrolled solid waste disposal facility. Many of the tip faces are steep and unstable and methane generation in the uncovered waste piles is spontaneously igniting causing smoldering surface fires. The proposed project plans to stop uncontrolled dumping on the site, control fires and re-contour and stabilize slopes so that a final cover can be installed and landfill gas emissions brought under control.  There is evidence that leachate from the landfills are contaminating surface waters in the vicinity of the sites and will be brought under control through the project. Although a significant portion of the material in the dumps has already decomposed or has burned, it is estimated that considerable amounts of biodegradable material remain, which will continue to generate methane after dumping at these sites has been halted. Appropriate closure of the dumps with capture and destruction of methane can produce major reductions in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from the sites.  Closure plans will therefore be designed and implemented specifically to reduce methane emissions. With the assistance of consultants, MCD have prepared a draft Master Plan for MSW treatment and disposal in Delhi and the neighboring regions of the State of Delhi . This Master Plan includes a number of assumptions about waste quantities, composition and gas generation potential that should be reviewed and refined in order to optimize the Plan for GHG reduction and earning Carbon Emission Reduction (CER) credits.  It is proposed to undertake this work concurrently with the current project, which would then form the basis for a potential second carbon credit application to implement the final Plan over the short (5 yr) and medium term (10 yr). Technology to be employed Options that will be considered and analyzed for closure/rehabilitation of the landfills will include conventional waste capping and gas collection systems as well as an alternative Evapo-transpiration Cover (ET)/bio-filter approach (see Annex 1).  The later approach, which is coming into increasing use in the US and Europe, is based on the provision of a layer of organic material, up to 1m thick, over the final waste contours.  This layer supports the growth of methanotropic bacteria which oxidize the methane to simpler products.   Available information indicates that inclusion of a high portion of compost material in this layer greatly enhances its performance.  Afforestation of closed landfills with native timber species is also part of ET landfill cover design. Some of the compost plants (with solid waste as input) owned or contracted by MCD are running under capacity due to various reasons (See Annex 2). In case the later technical option is preferred, these plants could provide the additional compost required for capping the landfills. Alternatively establishment of additional composting facilities may be considered if the demand or location considerations warrant. These plants could provide compost for future landfill capping or be used for daily cover material.
